    Questions and Hints
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<p>Each question/prediction task will resemble the one given in example below; the order assignment associated
    with each question will also be displayed. The outcome will be determined by computer randomly before
    the first character acts. Of course, the outcome will not be revealed to you until the question is resolved–
    meaning that the outcome will be revealed to all participants. Remember, the outcome and the tokens you
    own will jointly determine your payoff at the end of the experiment.
    You may receive hints as is displayed in the example below; similarly, other characters may receive a
    hint that resembles the one displayed to you, but contains different information. For example, Dwight may
    receive a hint that reads “There is a 20% chance that the color is black”. You may use this hint at your
    disposal. NEVER share this hint with other participants in the lab.</p>

    <p>In the example below, you are # 8 in the queue for this question; your buttons will be activated when all
        7 characters before you have placed their bets. Just like you, all characters will be able to see the order
        assignment, and the price, type, and number of tokens being purchased by the respective characters.
        A round is completed when the last person (in this example, Toby) has placed his bet. Each question
        may be consisted of multiple rounds, and each round would follow the same order assignment generated at
        the beginning of each question.</p>
