 <p>In the example below, you are # 2 in your group for this question; your buttons will be activated when all
        7 characters before you have placed their bets. Just like you, all characters will be able to see the order
        assignment, and the price, type, and number of tokens being purchased by the respective characters.
        A round is completed when the last person (in this example, Toby) has placed his bet. Each question
        may be consisted of multiple rounds, and each round would follow the same order assignment generated at
        the beginning of each question.</p>

        <p>In the example below, you are #2  in the queue for this question; you will place your bet after the first character's bet is placed, and before the third character's bet. 
            Just like you, all characters will be able to see the order assignment. A round is completed when the last character's bet has been placed.
