<p>In each section, you will be randomly assigned a character. In the example below, you will be Jim throughout session 1; similarly, Michael will be played by another participant in your group throughout session 1, and the same holds for other characters. For each question, all {{ Constants.players_per_group}} characters in your group will have a chance to place their bets in a sequential manner. Specifically, for each question, an order assignment will be generated by character Michael-- which determines who goes first, second, etc. In the example below, you are # 2 in the queue for this question; you will be able to submit your decision after the first player has submitted a decision.</p>
