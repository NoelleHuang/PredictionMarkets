<p>
This is round {{ player.subsession.round_number }}, the order is {{group.role_by_order }}. You are {{ player.role }}, so you are # {{ player.order }} to go. 
</p>    

<p>
There are two urns-- urn A and urn B, and in each urn there are exactly 3 balls. In urn A, there are 2 red balls and 1 green ball; in urn B, there are 1 red ball and 2 green balls. 
Now one of urn A and urn B is randomly selected, each of equal chance, and a ball is drawn from the selected urn, what color would the ball be?  
</p>
    
<p>
Rumour: If the drawn ball is put back to the selected urn, and draw another ball from the same urn, the color of the ball will be {{ player.private_signal}}.
</p>
